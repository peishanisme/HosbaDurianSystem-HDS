# 🌱 Blockchain & GIS-Powered Durian Farm Management System

A **cross-platform smart agriculture system** designed to digitalize durian farm operations using **Blockchain**, **GIS**, and **QR-based traceability**.  
This project enables secure, transparent, and data-driven management of durian farms — from tree-level records to fruit sales verification.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Traditional durian farming often relies on **manual record-keeping**, leading to:
- Poor traceability
- Delayed operational updates
- Data inconsistency
- Limited analytics for decision-making

This system solves those problems by providing:
- **Mobile app** for farm workers (on-site data collection)
- **Web dashboard** for farm managers
- **Blockchain-backed traceability** for fruits and transactions
- **Public QR portal** for consumer transparency
- **GIS-based tree location tracking**
